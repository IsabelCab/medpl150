<h1>Creative Statement</h1>
<p>My name is Isabel Cabral, and I am a sophomore majoring in Human Biology with plans to attend medical school. I aspire to become a pediatrician or an OB/GYN in the future. While medicine is my primary goal, I have always had a strong interest in design and creating new things. I believe there is value in exploring creative fields, and gaining experience in design can only broaden my perspective and skill set. I have always found animation and visual art interesting, and I wanted the opportunity to explore them further. My interest in media studies, however, comes from my curiosity about digital media and public relations, which is what ultimately led me to take this class. Although this is my first time working in this area, I am excited to learn, challenge myself creatively, and see how these skills may shape my future in unexpected ways.</p>
