<h2>Reading and Written Response #1 : Susan Sontag</h2>

<p>“In Plato's Cave” by Susan Sontag was very interesting, as it changed the way I thought about photography and image-making, not just in how we see images, but also in how we participate in them. She talks about inventory and how it began, and how even before smartphones, cameras were everywhere, capturing and distributing images that transform objects in real time into something we can store, remember, and collect. When Sontag says, “A photograph passes for incontrovertible proof that a given thing happened”, this resonated with me because it feels like keeping a piece of time from a place, like a freeze-frame of something that happened in the past. She also discusses the ethics of seeing, explaining that to take a photograph is to make a choice about what is worthy of attention and what is significant enough to be preserved. Thinking from the perspective of a media maker, this is extremely important, because the image you choose carries weight in what you are trying to create and communicate. I personally like to capture images for both personal and collective reasons. I like the idea of being able to look back at my images and remember, almost preserving a moment I might have otherwise forgotten, with the photograph helping me recall what happened. It feels like a personal archive of my experiences and moments I have lived. There is also a layer of photography that involves deciding what to include and exclude, what to emphasize and what to downplay. Sontag discusses the power held in taking an image, especially in terms of ethics and how a photographer’s perspective influences others and how they might perceive an event, person, or place. Every image communicates a narrative, whether consciously or not. This can be as simple as taking a photo during a walk in the park of a beautiful tree, or capturing an image of a family member. Photography, illustration, and graphic design all offer ways to visualize ideas about our world, but combining text and images open even more possibilities. Pairing images with words can help guide understanding while still leaving space for personal interpretation. When thinking about representing our current moment, I am drawn to themes of connection. Through photography, I can document everyday interactions and the spaces where people go to school or work, highlighting both shared experiences and disparities. Illustration and graphic designs can add another layer, helping contextualize these images in social, environmental, or political ways. Sontag reminds me that photography is more than documentation, but it's a tool for memory, reflection, and engagement. Each image I make is an intervention into the visual world and an opportunity to frame what is meaningful and express my ideas about reality and presence. Through this class, I hope to learn how to use photography and image-making to better showcase my world through my own perspective and beyond. Overall, this reading encouraged me to be more intentional, ethical and reflective about how I create images and how they represent my experiences and perspective. </p>
